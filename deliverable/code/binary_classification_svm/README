This is our improved version of binary classifier on “Larceny/Theft”. And we are using SVM  here.

In order to run get the result:
1. Put the data you’ve download “train.csv” in the data directory.
2. Simply cd to the current directory and run 
 python preprocess.py 
 python ml.py

And that’s done.

In this version, our accuracy is around 0.6 if everything goes right.
